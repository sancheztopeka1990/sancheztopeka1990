- 🏢 -I am currently working at the State of Kansas as an Application Developer utilizing the skills I learned during my educational pursuit; and picking up new ones as well - Yee Haw!

- 💗 - Here are some things I am excited about! ↓

- 💪 - A few proud achievements!  ↓

- Finding work in social service; albeit a temporary career choice, it provided me with a wealth of skills and a different mindset working with persons who suffer from incarceration, mental health disabilities,  substance use disorders and behavior and character flaws .  I am very passionate about changes revolving the dynamics regarding these issues in our world,  and am always open for dialogue. During my time in this field; I learned several unmatched soft skills in this work, but more importantly I learned how to be more compassionate and sympathetic towards others.

- Being a  strong advocate and collaborating professional with an emphasis on self and peer development, organizational communication, relationship building/management. I strive to use creativity, strategic planning, and of course a stellar sense of humor and positivity to accomplish meaningful and purposeful task, but also have the empathy to understand everyone from customers to co-workers may struggle; being there in whatever way I can is my goal during those times is one of a few of my daily goals; we are all in this together.
